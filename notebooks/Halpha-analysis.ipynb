    "  * the advantage of the latter is that all of the diagnostic plots will be in the same directory\n",

    "    * would need code to gather output from photometry into tables, like is done in the gui.\n",
    "    * I've done 111 galaxies with the gui so far, from 33 pointings...\n",
    "    * INT data has about 90 pointings.\n",
    "* tables from gui are in ~/research/Virgo/halpha-tables/\n",
    "* also need to update write_subtables to use match to the halpha output by RA and DEC, rather than VFID.  This will enable us to incorporate the results that were based on the v0 catalog, rather than having to redo them."
